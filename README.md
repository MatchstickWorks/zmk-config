# MatchstickWorks ZMK Sandbox
Check the releases on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MatchstickWorks/zmk-config/releases) for the most current build of MatchstickWorks' ZMK-powered keyboards.

## StrataPad
There are different versions of the StrataPad board.

If the back of the middle PCB only says "StrataPad v1" that means it's version 1.0.

Version 1.1 and going forward will have the proper second decimal version numbering printed on them.

### LED Function Enabled
Made use of the default functionality from this module: https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget
